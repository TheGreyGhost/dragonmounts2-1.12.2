The wavefront (obj model) parser code has been ported from a previous forge version.

It assumes the model is textured and uses triangles

Why not use the inbuilt OBJloader?  Because it appears to be hard-coded to use textures from the Item sheet (TextureAtlasSprites) and I couldn't figure out how to make it work properly with swappable textures.


Items expect their model to have coordinates [x,y,z] all 0-->1 and is then translated before rendering by -0.5, -0.5, -0.5

The EggModels expects the model to have its origin at [0, 0, 0], which means that the model should be occupy the extent:
[-0.5, 0, -0.5] to [0.5, 1.0, 0.5]
