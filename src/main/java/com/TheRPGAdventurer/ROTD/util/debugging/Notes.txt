will trigger a test case when held and clicked.  Changing the stacksize will change the test case that is executed.
For example - stacksize of 2 will run test case 2; stacksize of 20 will run test case 20.

Current test cases:
1..16(?) = spawn a tame adult dragon wearing a saddle, the test number corresponds to the breed of dragon

61 = forest breath test
62 = lightning breath test

Debug commands
/dragon debug overlay = toggle debug GUI on/off
/dragon debug spawnInhibitor = toggle spawn inhibition (stops entities from spawning, useful if you want to study the dragon entity without any others nearby)
  also useful: /kill @e[type=!Player]
/dragon debug animationFrozen = enable animation freezing.  When animation freezing is enabled:
   1) hold the dragon orb
   2) hold either left or right mouse button to start the desired breath
   3) while holding the first button, click the other mouse button as well.
   This will cause the dragon to stop updating on the client and the server, as well as any breathnodes
   To cancel the freezing, use /dragon debug animationFrozen to toggle it off
/dragon debug renderCentrepoints = toggle rendering of centrepoints on/off (breath nodes, dragon throat location)
