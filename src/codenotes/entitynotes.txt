The creation of an entity occurs in the following stages:

For spawning of a new entity:
1) Call the constructor- could be MyEntity(World) but also MyEntity(World, x, y, z) or MyEntity(World, other custom parameters)
  a) set your x,y,z, etc in the constructor
  b) myEntity.entityInit() will be called; register your DataParameters with EntityDataManager in here
  c) applyEntityAttributes() will be called; register and/or set your Attributes here.  They will be sent from server to client.
  d) on the server: initEntityAI()

2) Call worldIn.spawnEntity(myEntity);
3) vanilla will then setup a tracker which will send the DataParameters to the client.
Then on the client:
4) myEntityClient = new MyEntity(world) will be called
5) myEntityClient notifyDataManagerChange will be called for all DataParameters

For reloading of an existing entity from disk:
1) myEntityServer = new MyEntity(world) will be called
2) myEntityServer.readEntityFromNBT will be called
the client then follows as above.
