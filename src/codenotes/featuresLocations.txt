DragonLifeStageHelper: Max health, attack damage, armour
 - aging, stop/start growth
 - applies the lifestage modifiers.
 - the lifestage modifiers are intended for discrete/sudden changes, such as a different sound, or different texture
    they're not intended to be used for health, armour, attack damage, breath weapon properties, etc.  If used for these
    purposes they may give unexpected results...

DragonConfigurationHelper: Storing all breed+modifier configuration information

DragonReproductionHelper: Reproduction & mating
  - each dragon has a maximum # of times it can reproduce.
  - when max is reached, dragon acquires the "infertile" modifier
  - only reproduce if: tamed, fertile, and has high enough emotional maturity
  - dragon is either male (default) or female.
  - only reproduce if in "love mode" (EntityAnimal vanilla)
  - the child breed is randomly either of the parents, and is named as a combination of the parents
  - can only enter "love mode" if fertile and has high enough emotional maturity (hasReachedReproductiveAge)

DragonInteractHelper: Player->Dragon interactions (as per vanilla) in
  - looks like originally intended to have one class per interaction but later decided not to.
Valid interactions for:
  - dragon whistle - various
  - bone: dragon sits
  - stick: dragon sits
  - food: instanceof ItemFood-->
    - fish or dragonfood->
      * if untamed -> random chance of taming
      * depending on hungerDecrement config: either heal dragon, or raise its hunger satiation
      * if fully satiated, and this is a breeding item, set dragon in love
    - shrinking food or growing food, to pause or restart growth.
  - click without interacting item -> riding (not sneaking) or dragon GUI (with sneaking)
Checks if the dragon is untamed, or tamed by someone else.
Knows who the controlling player is.

Interactions:
   1) First checks to see if the item is a type that the dragon will eat
      If not, proceed to (2)
      If so:
      If the dragon isn't tamed, eat the item and give a random chance of taming.
      If the dragon is already tamed, check if the dragon is hungry, or is not hungry but requires healing
        If so, eats the item and exits.
        If not, proceed to (2)
   2) Checks to see if the item is a breeding item
      If not, proceeds to (3)
      If so, checks to see if the dragon is not in love already, and is capable of breeding.
        If so, put the dragon into love mode and consume the item
      Exit.

   If the item is food and/or breeding- exit at this point.

   3) If the dragon isn't tamed, give a warning message and exit.
   4) If the dragon is tamed for someone else, and has not been told to allow other players, give a warning message and exit
   5) If the item is a saddle, and the dragon isn't already saddled, saddle it
   4) If the item is neither food nor breeding, and the player isn't holding shift (sneaking), attempt to mount the dragon:
      If the dragon isn't saddled, give a warning message
   5) If the item is neither food nor breeding, and the player is holding shift, open the dragon GUI




DragonCombatHelper: Health, attacks, damage (not including breath weapons)
- implements hunger:
  - will affect AI hunting
  - dragon auto-heals when hunger is full or nearly full; is simpler implementation than player (no saturation or exhaustion):
    a) when hunger is > threshold, then regenerate health proportional to (hunger - threshold) / (max hunger - threshold) * max_regen_rate
    b) if dragon is fed when already full, heal an amount of damage proportional to hunger_fed * max_health / max_hunger
    c) when hunger drops to zero, it doesn't cause health damage
  configurables: MAX_HUNGER (units per health), HUNGER_DECAY_RATE (% per minute), HUNGER_HEAL_THRESHOLD (%), MAX_HEALTH_REGEN_RATE (% of max health per minute)
  A dragon's max hunger is proportional to its health.  So when you feed it food, the amount of hunger restored (as a %) is greater for a small dragon than a large dragon.  Or in other
    words, a larger dragon needs more food than a smaller dragon.
  When a dragon reaches full hunger, it stays full for FULLNESS_TIME before hunger starts to decrease again.
