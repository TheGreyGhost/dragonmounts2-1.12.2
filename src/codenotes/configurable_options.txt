Configuration system:
* look in a configuration directory and read all the files in there
* One json file per breed


Questions?
* How to keep entity ID etc stable if config options change?
* How to register resources?

One egg only; don't use variants explicitly.

How the configuration files work:
The configuration file for each breed has a number of categories; each category relates to an aspect of the dragon
eg
egg = properties of the egg
physical model = properties of the dragon model / appearance
breathweapon = properties of the dragon's breathweapon

Within each category, there are a number of tags which can be defined,
eg
EggSize = 0.25 // size of egg (width, height) in metres
If a tag is not explicitly defined, it takes on a default value.

Each category can also be "modified" to reflect variations on the breed, for example male or female, christmasedition, etc

The typical usage for this is to define the base category without modifiers, then redefine some aspects in subsequent modified categories
for example

"physicalmodel": { // base model
"size": 2.0, //metres
"texture": "base_texture.png"
}

"physicalmodel:female":  {  // female modifier
"size": 1.5
}

"physicalmodel:christmasedition": {
"texture": "christmas_texture.png"
}

The female is smaller than the base model but has the same texture.
The christmas edition is the same size as the base model but has a different texture.
the female christmas edition has both smaller size and different texture.

Some modifiers are mutually exclusive (eg male, female), others can be combined, etc

"physicalmodel:male,christmasedition"
