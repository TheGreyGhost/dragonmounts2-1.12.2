LIFE STAGE
The original idea of life stages seems a bit irrelevant now
What do we want the age to affect?
 * size of dragon (ageScale)
 * size of breath weapon  - breathweapon maturity
 * behaviour:
    - baby follows parents
    - running away from threats
    - hunting
 * abilities
   - can dragon carry someone?
   - can dragon fly?
   - how many passengers?
   - can dragon ride on someone's shoulder?  (is this a factor of size not age ?)


Could still apply a label to the age eg infant, child, juvenile (teenager), adult
see TypicalGrowthCurve figures
For gameplay reasons we probably want to add a longer infant phase because it's cuter.
Do they get elderly too?

Controllable parameters:
Age of teenager (growth spurt?)
Age fully grown
Size at birth
Full-grown size
