LIFE STAGE
The original idea of life stages seems a bit irrelevant now
What do we want the age to affect?
 * size of dragon (ageScale)
 * size of breath weapon  - breathweapon maturity
 * behaviour:
    - baby follows parents
    - running away from threats
    - hunting
 * abilities
   - can dragon carry someone?
   - can dragon fly?
   - how many passengers?
   - can dragon ride on someone's shoulder?  (is this a factor of size not age ?)


Could still apply a label to the age for modelling purposes:
Hatchling -> Infant -> Child -> EarlyTeen -> LateTeen -> Adult
see TypicalGrowthCurve figures
For gameplay reasons we probably want to add a longer hatchling phase because it's cuter.
Do they get elderly too?  no.

Controllable parameters:


Age of teenager (growth spurt?)
Age fully grown
Size at birth
Full-grown size

How to model maturity?
Make LifeStageHelper responsible?

LifeStageHelper should produce:
1) PhysicalSize (metres)
2) PhysicalMaturity (0->100%)
3) EmotionalMaturity (0->100%)
4) BreathWeaponMaturity (0->100%)

Configurable parameters:
AGEHATCHLING = 0
AGEINFANT
AGECHILD
AGEEARLYTEEN
AGELATETEEN
AGEADULT

GROWTHRATE{HATCHLING TO LATETEEN}
PHYSICALMATURITY{HATCHLING TO LATETEEN}
EMOTIONALMATURITY{HATCHLING TO LATETEEN}
BREATHWEAPONMATURITY{HATCHLING TO LATETEEN}
