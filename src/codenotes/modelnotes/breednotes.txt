Different types of dragons:
* added by configuration file
* directory which contains config files, code reads in all of them, one per breed

Breed:
- name of breed
- has a DragonVariants
- generate dragon

DragonFactory: takes breed as parameter?

The various helpers no longer use Breed, they use DragonVariants in their initialiser instead

DragonFactory needs to read in the DragonVariants for all breeds

A dragon still needs a Breed tag for reproduction and matching, label, etc

Breed should contain:
* name
* breed-specific information?  can't think of anything
* VariantsTag?  or does the factory hold that?

How do DataParameters work?
